Python files - Thesis Boudewijn Schiermeier

Hello,

This repository contains all final python files used for my Master Thesis. Note: these are final files, files that contain tests, (a lot of) errors & different models are not indicated as these are irrelevant. Each model is separated in an AMX and AEX file, for both indices. All files contain descriptions in the file itself as well. All notebooks start with a type I model without Google SVI, after which the type II model is also indicated.

Enjoy!

Boudewijn
